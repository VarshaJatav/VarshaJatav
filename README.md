# 👋 Hi, I’m Varsha Jatav

💻 I'm a Backend Software Engineer with ~2 years of experience building scalable REST APIs and backend systems using **Node.js**, **NestJS**, and **Express.js**.

🚀 I’ve worked on live production apps involving:
- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** using Twig & HTML/CSS
- **Data visualization** with Power BI and D3.js
- **Third-party integrations** like Stripe, Chart.js
- **Performance optimization**, including reducing PDF render time by over 60%

🎯 I enjoy solving real-world backend challenges, mentoring juniors, and working directly with clients to deliver reliable, high-performance systems.

🌱 Currently exploring system design, scalable architecture, and DevOps fundamentals.
